# SmartClassRoom

This repository contains the source code to run on Arduino; the code is a simulation for a *Smart Classroom*, but what makes a class room smart?

<h3> What makes a Class Room Smart </h3>

Calculating the students attendance automatically just by attending 75% of the total session time, students enters using an RF-ID
and Teachers start the session by also scanning his/her RF-id.
Not only calculating attendance but also the class room is safe and contains smoke detectors for Emergency fires or etc,
when these sensors are triggered with smoke the session gets cancelled and a buzzer triggers, class room door opens and red light flag indicating emergency case.
